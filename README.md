# Python-Lifelines-Survival-Analysis
Survival Analysis using KaplanMeierFitter from lifelines library. Used NASA turbofan dataset.


Some background...


This is a group project that myself and two others worked on for a BANA class at SHSU.
We had to create/find a business problem and solve it using business analytics.
We decided that we were a water pump company and wanted to let our customers know when to replace their pumps
before they failed.
We adapted the NASA turbofan engine degredation dataset to fit into our project.
